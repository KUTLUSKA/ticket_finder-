# ticket_finder-
I made this project because I am in a long distace realationship and i do not want to search ticket every day.
***For use the script you have to install pypuppetter and asyinco pip modules first 
***Then you can write the destinations and time for your ride then leave it it will search for you. 
***When it finds the ticket, it will send message from discord. i know just bad mindset bro.
